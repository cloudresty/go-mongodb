## Security Best Practices

&nbsp;

### Environment Configuration

&nbsp;

#### Secure Connection URLs

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use secure protocols and explicit configuration
export MONGODB_HOSTS=cluster.example.com:27017
export MONGODB_TLS_ENABLED=true
export MONGODB_DATABASE=myapp

# ‚úÖ Good: Strong authentication
export MONGODB_USERNAME=app_user
export MONGODB_PASSWORD=strong_random_password

# ‚ùå Avoid: Default credentials
export MONGODB_USERNAME=""
export MONGODB_PASSWORD=""
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

#### TLS Configuration

```go
// Enable TLS with proper verification
config := &mongodb.Config{
    Host:        "cluster.example.com",
    Port:        27017,
    Database:    "myapp",
    TLSEnabled:  true,
    TLSInsecure: false, // Always verify certificates in production
}

client, err := mongodb.NewClientWithConfig(config)
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### Access Control

&nbsp;

#### Connection Permissions

- Use dedicated service accounts for applications
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

#### MongoDB User Configuration

```bash
# Create dedicated user for your application
use myapp
db.createUser({
  user: "myapp_user",
  pwd: "secure_password",
  roles: [
    { role: "readWrite", db: "myapp" }
  ]
})

# Remove default admin user in production environments
# Follow MongoDB security best practices
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### Network Security

&nbsp;

#### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
# MongoDB: 27017 (default) or custom port
# Only from trusted networks and IP ranges
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

#### VPC/Network Isolation

- Deploy MongoDB in private subnets
- Use VPC endpoints where available
- Implement network segmentation
- Monitor network traffic

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### Message Security

&nbsp;

#### Sensitive Data Handling

```go
// ‚ùå Avoid: Putting sensitive data in document fields without encryption
document := bson.M{
    "credit_card": "4111-1111-1111-1111", // Never do this
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Encrypt sensitive data before storing
encryptedData, err := encrypt(sensitiveData)
document := bson.M{
    "encrypted_data": encryptedData,
    "encryption_info": bson.M{
        "encrypted": true,
        "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
    },
}
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

#### Document Encryption

```go
// Example: Encrypt document fields before inserting
func insertSecureDocument(collection *mongodb.Collection, data any) error {
    // Encrypt sensitive fields
    encryptedDoc, err := encryptSensitiveFields(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Insert encrypted document
    result, err := collection.InsertOne(ctx, encryptedDoc)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return nil
}
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### Logging Security

&nbsp;

#### Automatic PII Protection

The package automatically sanitizes sensitive information in logs:

```go
// Connection URLs are automatically sanitized
emit.Info.StructuredFields("Connecting to MongoDB",
    emit.ZString("host", sanitizeHost(connectionHost))) // Passwords removed
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

#### Custom Log Sanitization

```go
// Sanitize custom sensitive data
func logOperation(documentID string, userID string) {
    emit.Info.StructuredFields("Processing document",
        emit.ZString("document_id", documentID),
        emit.ZString("user_id", sanitizeUserID(userID))) // Custom sanitization
}

func sanitizeUserID(userID string) string {
    if len(userID) <= 4 {
        return "***"
    }
    return userID[:4] + "***"
}
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

## Known Security Considerations

&nbsp;

### Document Persistence vs Performance

- **Acknowledged writes** are safer but slower
- **Unacknowledged writes** are faster but can be lost
- Choose based on your security/performance requirements

```go
// High security: Use acknowledged writes with journal
config := mongodb.InsertConfig{
    WriteConcern: writeconcern.Majority(),
    Journal:      true, // Wait for journal confirmation
}

// High performance: Use faster writes for non-critical data
config := mongodb.InsertConfig{
    WriteConcern: writeconcern.Unacknowledged(),
    Journal:      false, // Faster but can be lost
}
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### Connection Security

&nbsp;

#### Connection Limits

```go
// Configure connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
config := &mongodb.Config{
    URI:            "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    MaxPoolSize:    100,   // Limit connections in pool
    MinPoolSize:    5,     // Minimum pool size
    MaxIdleTime:    time.Minute * 10, // Connection idle timeout
    ConnectTimeout: time.Second * 10, // Connection timeout
}
```

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### GridFS Security

- GridFS collections may contain sensitive file data
- Implement appropriate access controls for GridFS
- Consider data retention policies for stored files
- Monitor GridFS storage for security issues

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;

### ULID Security

ULIDs are designed to be safe for use as public identifiers:

- **No sensitive information**: ULIDs don't contain user data
- **Collision resistant**: Cryptographically secure randomness
- **Time-based**: Only timestamp is extractable (no other metadata)
- **URL safe**: No encoding issues or injection risks

üîù [back to top](#security-policy)

&nbsp;
